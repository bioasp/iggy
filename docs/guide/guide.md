## What are `iggy` and `opt_graph` ?

`iggy` and `optgraph` are tools for consistency based analysis of influence graphs and
 observed systems behavior (signed changes between two measured states).
For many (biological) systems are knowledge bases available that describe the interaction
 of its components in terms of causal networks, boolean networks and influence graphs
  where edges indicate either positive or negative effect of one node upon another.

`iggy` implements methods to check the consistency of large-scale data sets and provides explanations
for inconsistencies.
In practice, this is used to identify unreliable data or to indicate missing reactions.
 Further, `iggy` addresses the problem of repairing networks and corresponding yet often discrepant
  measurements in order to re-establish their mutual consistency and predict unobserved variations
  even under inconsistency.

`opt_graph` confronts interaction graph models with observed systems behavior from multiple experiments.
`opt_graph` computes networks fitting the observation data by removing (or adding) a minimal number of edges in the given network.

You can download the precompiled binaries for 64bit linux and macos on the [release page](https://github.com/bioasp/iggy/releases).

Sample data is available here: [demo_data.tar.gz](https://bioasp.github.io/iggy/downloads/demo_data.tar.gz)

## Input Model + Data

`iggy` and `opt_graph` work with two kinds of data.
The first is representing an interaction graph model.
The second is the experimental data, representing experimental condition and observed behavior.

### Model

The model is represented as file in complex interaction format `CIF` as shown below.
Lines in the `CIF` file specify a interaction between (multiple) source nodes and one target node.

    shp2                        ->  grb2_sos
    !mtor_inhibitor             ->  mtor
    ?jak2_p                     ->  stat5ab_py
    !ras_gap&grb2_sos           ->  pi3k
    akt&erk&mtor&pi3k           ->  mtorc1
    gab1_bras_py                ->  ras_gap
    gab1_ps&jak2_p&pi3k         ->  gab1_bras_py

In our influence graph models we have simple interactions like:
in Line 1 for `shp2` *increases* `grb2_sos`
and in Line 2 the `!` indicates that `mtor_inhibitor` tends to *decrease* `mtor`.
in Line 3 the `?` indicates an unknown influence of `jak2_p` on `stat5ab_py`.
Complex interactions can be composed with the `&` operator to model a combined influence of multiple sources on a tartget.
In Line 4 an decrease in `ras_gap` with an increase in `grb2_sos` tend to increase `pi3k`.


### Experimental data

The experimental data is given in the file format shown below.
Nodes which are perturbed in the experimental condition are denoted as `input`.
The first line of the example below states that `depor` has been perturbed in the experiment.
This means `depor` has been under the control of the experimentalist
 and its behavior must therefore not be explained.
The behavior of a node can be either `+`, `-`, `0`, `notPlus`, `notMinus`.
Line 2 states that an *increase* (`+`) was obeserved in `depor`,
 as it is declared an `input` this behavior has been caused by the experimentalist.
Line 3 states that `stat5ab_py` has *decreased* (`-`) and
line 4 states that `ras` has *not changed* (`0`).
Line 5 states that an *uncertain decrease* (`notPlus`) has been observed in `plcg` and
line 6 states that an *uncertain increase* (`notMinus`) has been observed in `mtorc1`.
Line 7 states that `akt` is initially on the minimum level, this means it cannot further decrease, and
line 8 states that `grb2_sos` is initially on the maximum level, this means it cannot further increase.


    depor         = input
    depor         = +
    stat5ab_py    = -
    ras_gap       = 0
    jak2_p        = notPlus
    mtorc1        = notMinus
    akt           = MIN
    pi3k          = MAX


### Consistency notions

The Iggy tools implement different constraints that inform the consistency notion under which the analysis are perform. In other words what is considere a consistent behaviour of a system. The defaults are 
 + All observed changes must be explained by an predecessor.

    This is the basic constraint that must always hold.
   
 + All observed changes must be explained by an input.

    You can turn this off with the flag `--founded_constraints_off`.

 + 0-change must be explained.

   You can turn this constraint off with the flag `--fwd_propagation_off`.

Additionaly you can turn on the following constraint:
  + An elementary path from an input must exist to explain changes.
   You can turn this constraint on with the flag `--elempath`.

With the flag `--depmat` you can turn on a consistency notion that is used for the *dependency matrix*. This notion includes the *elementary path* constraint.

For more information on the consistency notion see:

## Iggy

`iggy` performs consistency checks for an interaction model and a data profile. 
It computes explanations (minimal inconsistent cores *mics*) for inconsistencies
 and suggests repairs for model and data.

The *mics* are connected parts of the model and indicate unreliable data or missing reactions.
The repairs re-establish the mutual consistency between model and data, and enable predictions of unobserved behavior even under inconsistency.

The typical usage of `iggy` is:

    $ iggy -n network.cif -o observation.obs -l 10 -p


For more options you can ask for help as follows:

    Iggy confronts interaction graph models with observations of (signed) changes between
    two measured states (including uncertain observations). Iggy discovers inconsistencies
    in networks or data, applies minimal repairs, and predicts the behavior for the
    unmeasured species. It distinguishes strong predictions (e.g. increase in a node) and
    weak predictions (e.g., the value of a node increases or remains unchanged

### Compute minimal correction sets (mcos) or *scenfit* and predictions under inconsistency

`iggy` implements two measures for inconsistency *minimal correction sets (mcos)* and *scenfit*. While *mcos* measures the minimal number of observations that cannot be explained, *scenfit* measures a minimal number of changes to the model to re-establish the mutual consistency between model and data.
The default in iggy is *mcos* but *scenfit* can be used with the option `--scenfit`.

With the option `--show_labelings, -l N` `iggy` computes at most `N` such labelings and repairs that are consistent.

With the flag `--show_predictions, -p` `iggy` computes predictions under inconsistencies.
More precisely the behaviors of the system that are invariant also under the minimal repairs.

`iggy` presents the results of its analysis as text output.
The output of `iggy` can be redirected into a file using the `>` operator.
For example to write the results shown below into the file `myfile.txt` type:

    $ iggy -n network.cif -o observations.obs -l 10 -p > myfile.txt


In the following we will dissect the output generated by `iggy`.
The first 3 lines of the output state the constraints that have been used to analyze network and data.
For our example it is the default setting with the following constraints.
For a deeper understanding of these constraints see~\cite{sthiele15}.

    + All observed changes must be explained by an predecessor.
    + 0-change must be explained.
    + All observed changes must be explained by an input.
    _____________________________________________________________________

Next follow some statistics on the input data.
Line 4-5 tells us that the influence graph model given as `network.cif`
consists of `18` species nodes and `4` complex nodes,
with `19` edges with activating influence
and `6` edges with inhibiting influence
and `1` edge with `Unknown`  influence.

Line 9 tells that the experimental data given as `observation.obs` in itself is `consistent`,
which means it does not contain contradictory observations.
Line 11 tells that the experimental conditions has `2` perturbations marked as `input` nodes,
that `4` nodes were observed as increased `+`,
`1` node *decreased* (`-`),
`7` nodes did *not change* (`0`),
`1` node were observed with an *uncertain decrease* (`notPlus`),
`1` node were observed with an *uncertain increase* (`notMinus`),
`1` node were observed with an *minimum level* (`MIN`),
`1` node were observed with an *maximum level* (`MAX`),
`4` nodes were `unobserved` and the experimental data contained `0` observations of species that are not in the given model.

    Reading network model from "network.cif".

    # Network statistics

        OR nodes (species): 18
        AND nodes (complex regulation): 4
        Activations = 19
        Inhibitions = 6
        Unknowns = 1

    Reading observations from "observations.obs".

    # Observations statistics

        unobserved nodes     : 4
        observed nodes       : 18
         inputs                : 2
         +                     : 4
         -                     : 1
         0                     : 7
         notPlus               : 1
         notMinus              : 1
         Min                   : 1
         Max                   : 1
         observed not in model : 0


Then follow the results of the consistency analysis.
Line 14 tells us that network and data are inconsistent
and that the size of a *minimal correction set* (`mcos`) is `2`.
This means that at least `2` influences need to be added to restore consistency.
For a deeper understanding of mcos see~\cite{samaga13a}.
Further the output contains at most `10` consistent labeling including correction set.
This is because we choose to set the flag `--show_labelings 10`.
In our example we have `4` possible labelings.
Each labeling represents a consistent behavior of the model (given mcos the corrections).
`Labeling 1`,
tells it is possible that
`mek1` *increases* (`+`),
`shp2_ph` and `mtorc` do *not change* (`0`) and that
`stat5ab_py` *decrease* (`-`).
Line 26 tells us that this is a consistent behavior if `MTOR` would receive a positive influence,
which is currently not included in the model.
`Labeling 3`, represents an alternative behavior,
 here `mtorc1` does *increases* (`+`}).
Please note that in this example both labelings are consistent under the same correction set.
In another example more than one minimal correction set could exists.
    
    The network and data are inconsistent: mcos = 2.
    
    Compute mcos labelings ... done.

Finally the prediction results are listed.
A prediction is a statement that hold under all labeling under all minimal repairs.
For a formal definition of predictions see~\cite{sthiele15}.
Here the predictions say that
`gab1_ps` *always increases* (`+`),
`stat5ab_py` *always decreases* (`-`),
`shp2` always stays *unchanged* (`0`),
`mtorc1` *never decreases* (`notMinus`), and
`brb2` always stays *never increases* (`notPlus`),

### Compute minimal inconsistent cores `--mics`

Iggy computes minimal inconsistent cores *mics* for inconsistent model and data.
The *mics* are connected parts of the model and indicate unreliable data or missing reactions. 
To compute the minimal inconsistent cores use the flag `--mics` as follows:

    $ iggy -n data/Yeast/yeast_guelzim.cif  -o data/Yeast/yeast_snf2.obs --mics
    _____________________________________________________________________

## Opt_graph
`opt_graph` confronts interaction graph models with observed systems behavior from multiple experiments.
`opt_graph` computes networks fitting the observation data by removing (or adding) a minimal number of edges in the given network.

Typical usage is:


    $ opt_graph -n network.cif -o observations_dir/ --show_repairs 10


For more options you can ask for help as follows:


    $ opt_graph -h
