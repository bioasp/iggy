Ecoli_2013.sif
 - was extracted from RegulonDB on October 2013
 - It has 4477 edges, 1742 nodes
 - Mostly activations and inhibitions, but it also has B (for interactions with both signs) and ? (for unknown signed)

exp
 - Contains a list of 105 experiments extracted from Sangurdekar et al 2006 (all public data)
 - paper ref at: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1557986/
 - The data is on Log2(ratio), I used the following thresholds to decide +,-,0: 
	+ if exp >= 1.0
	- if exp <= -1.0
	0 if -0.2 <= exp <= 0.2
 - Each .obs file only contains observations on the network nodes, the name of the experiment and the number of non-observed nodes
 - For time series data, I chose the last time point

This data is easy to generate with different thresholds
